# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts

## About

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket
2. The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw
3. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner, and this will be done automatically
4. Using Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation
5. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
6. Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger

## Tests
1. Write some deploy scripts
2. Write our tests (local chain, forked testnet, forked mainnet)
